This was a small excel project, that I did to test my Data Cleaning skills.

I used functions such as ; left, mid, right, trim.

I was able to learn iferror()

On some values it would have been easier to use textafter() and textbefore() but my Excel did not have these functions
but all in all Google was of much help.

Some fields did not require cleaning as I did not see them as important in the visualization phase,
especially the client column.

!!--Looking forward to doing more--!!
